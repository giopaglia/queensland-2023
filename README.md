# Proceedings of an on-the-road holiday in Queensland, November 2023


Adventurous holidays are personal matter. However! Me and my girlfriend took a week off of work for discovering the rainforest, vast beaches and the Great Barrier Reef in North Queensland; we were amazed by the places we visited, and noticed that Lonely Planet didn’t advise the kind of things that we enjoyed. So we collected our thoughts and plans in markdown, and open sourced them.

These notes mainly contain advices for travellers in their 20s/30s. Sometimes you’ll find prices \$\$\$ in AUD (Australian Dollar), which currently is worth 0.6EUR and 0.66USD.

## Car rent
If you have limited time, rent a car and drive around!!! I suggest you get an Australian driver’s license (I got mine in 30 minuetes for 60\$ in Sydney at NSW Service), or an official international translation of your own license.
East Coast Car Rental, Shuttle from/to airport. Hyundai i30 for 6 days, full insurance cover (energic lady Mya at the counter stressed that you pay ZERO and they get you a new car in case of accidents), total cost 500\$. Fuel for the whole run was 150\$ (Unleaded 91, ~1.86\$/L).

## Fitzroy Camping (no car required)
Taxi from Cairns Airport to Cairns ~28\$, 10 minutes. About three companies operate ferries and day trips to the island, and the price is around 90\$ for a round trip, book a few days later. One company has a resort and a camping. Food: on the island there is a fancy restaurant, a convenience store that also sells pasties, pies and sandwiches, and a beach bar. Rent camping gear 100\$/day, they give you a funny cart to bring to the campsite (8 mins from the jetty) with many things. Big tent, ours was a little stinky and air didn’t flow that much. Great mats and sleeping bag. Book safari tours 2 days in advance (about 60\$ 1.45h, 85\$ 2.15h), or rent snorkelling gear (36\$/person suit, snorkel and fins). Nudey Beach is a chill 20-minute walk where you see animals (mainly tiny lizards). The sea was not special though; go there for the swing.
Animals we saw: Cacatua, chicken-like birds, varanus lizards, smaller lizards, geckos, a lot of colorful fish (some bigger than us), a majestic ray, a beautiful sea turtle.

## Cow Bay/Cape Tribulation
Daintree Ferry crosses the river about once every 15 mins. Crossing Fees:
- Car: 47\$ round trip, 27\$ one way
- Person: 5\$ round trip, 4\$ one way

Crocodylus Hostel: gorgeous, super quite, I wish I could stay for months and work from there. It’s like a camping in the jungle but with elevated dwellings, each dwelling has 4 spacious rooms mosquito nets so you are protected from spiders and all. Super clean, shared toilets, a few meters away. Has electricity only for half of the day, which is also good. No music, only nature sounds. Jungle in the night is... loud. Night walk is only 45\$/person, Jamie Scottish/Queenslander guide in its 60s, great storytelling and experience. Crocodile tour: in 30mins from the hostel you get to the ferry, go down, take the ferry 5\$ two way, 7 min walk to Solar Whisper, 1h/2h crocodile tour is 30\$/60\$/person.
Animals we saw: Tent spider, Huntsman spider, Wolf spider, Lizards, Melomys, Beetle, Cochroach, Cassowary, big crickets, turtle, eel, orange-eyed prawns, crocodiles.
Animals we didn’t see: –

We also saw many interesting and creepy plants (waitawhile, strangler figue, giant palms of many sorts)

Thorton Beach Bungalows by the sea are pretty awesome. The beach is 20sec walking distance, gigantic, no one’s there, and the bungalows have everything you need for relaxing. Forest animals, sea sounds, fridge, BBQ & cooking. Many funny animals but don’t go there if you don’t like rodents. Btw I went to the beach in the night and it was like daydreaming, I’ve never seen anything like that. So romantic, in the artistic sense.
Animals we saw: melomys, fawn-footed rat, musky rat-kangaroo
Animals we didn’t see: Tree Kangaroo, Cassowary.

Ps don’t go eat kangaroo and crocodile burgers because eating meat is bad for everyone. Plus the taste is not that special at all.

Mossman is nice for a short stop, bu Mossman Gorge looks super turistic. We stopped at Mossman Gorge Cultural Center, from where you are taken to Mossman Gorge by shuttles 14\$/adult. The place was so crowded and exploited, we decided not to embark in the visit.

## South Mission
BUG4 Tasman holiday inn has really nice beach bungalows for a good price.

## Trinity Beach
Quite turistic, there are only some restaurants and Holiday Inns. Kuranda market is nice, but avoid Kuranda Koala Gardens. It's a zoo.
